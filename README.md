# Supercenter_Sales
 
The dataset in this analysis is one of the historical sales of a supermarket company in Myanmar that has recorded 3 months of sales data over 3 months. Each row of the dataset contains information for a single shopping run for a given customer, including information such as on who the customer is, the amount they spent, and what they rated their shopping experience.

The sales data is explored and analyzed to provide insights to management of the supercenter owners. More exploration and statistical analysis is coming soon.
